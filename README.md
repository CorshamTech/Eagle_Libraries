These are libraries used in Corsham Technologies LLC prodcuts (www.corshamtech.com).

Let's face it, nobody except for a few lawyers has any idea what all the different licenses mean, so let me make my intentions clear:

1. The libraries are free to use for both commerical and private uses.

2. There is no implied warrantee of any kind.  Ie, they might have errors and are not guaranteed for any particular use.

3. There is no implied maintenance.


#SS-50.lbr
#---------

This is for constructing SS-50 and SS-30 compatible boards.  It includes both male and female Molex connectors.  For constructing plug-in boards using a female connector my suggestion is to place the center of the library part 0.15" above the bottom of the board.

#S-100.lbr
#---------

This is for constructing S-100 boards and is, for now, more of an experimental library rather than something that has any sort of polish about it.  Feel free to use but don't be too disappointed when it does not meet your expectations.
